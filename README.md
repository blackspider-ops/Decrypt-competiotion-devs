# Code Break Arena

A competitive programming challenge platform built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase.

## Project Overview

Code Break Arena is a web-based platform for hosting competitive programming challenges. Participants can solve coding problems, track their progress, and compete on leaderboards.

## Features

- **Challenge System**: Multiple coding challenges with varying difficulty levels
- **Real-time Leaderboard**: Track participant rankings and scores
- **User Profiles**: Personal progress tracking and statistics
- **Admin Panel**: Comprehensive management tools for organizers
- **Certificate System**: Award certificates to participants
- **Event Management**: Control event status and settings

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom cyber-themed components
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd code-break-arena
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file with your Supabase credentials:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Building for Production

### Prerequisites for Production
- Node.js 18+ 
- All environment variables configured
- Supabase project set up with proper RLS policies

### Build Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

### Production Deployment
1. Set up environment variables in your hosting platform
2. Build the project: `npm run build`
3. Deploy the `dist` folder contents to your web server
4. Configure your web server to serve `index.html` for all routes (SPA routing)
5. Ensure HTTPS is enabled
6. Test all functionality in production environment

### Hosting Recommendations
- **Vercel**: Zero-config deployment with automatic HTTPS
